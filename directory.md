## Project Directory [Windows]: 

We are now going to "go into" (or call) the folder (the directory) we downloaded for Watson Beat.

Go to your Start Menu, and type "cmd". Right click to "Run as Administrator".

Command ```cd \```

Do you know which User you are? If not, press and hold on your keyboard `Ctr` `Alt` and `Del` to open your Task Manager. In the menu, select the User tab, that is your username. :)

Back to the terminal, ```Dir```. NOTE: Windows is not case-sensitive like other operating systems, so you could do ```dir``` too.

`dir` command lists all the directories. See the directory called "Users"? We are going to ```cd``` (cd = "call directory") which will place us in the "Users" directory.

```cd Users```

```dir```

See your username? 

```cd [YOUR_USERNAME]```

```dir```

Lets go to the project. I am assuming that this project is in the Downloads folder right now. If you placed it somewhere else, like ```Desktop```, then ```cd Desktop```. But I will assume that it is still within the Downloads folder for now.

```cd Downloads```

What is the project folder you extracted called? Mine is `watson-beat-master`. 

```cd [PROJECT FOLDER]```

There you have it! You can now go back to the [project directory](https://github.com/watson-music/watson-beat) and proceed with the tutorial.










## Project Directory [Mac]
<hr>

We are now going to "go into" (or call) the folder (the directory) we downloaded for Watson Beat.

A) Open your terminal, so for Mac: Go to your Finder and select "Applications" and then the "Utilities" as shown.

<br>
From here, you should see your Terminal window (black box)

Optional) Open this up and type `sudo -s` to become a superuser for this session.

B) Type `pwd` in your terminal to see where you are now on your computer. Then `ls` to get a list of your directory you are in.

You should see `Downloads` here. This is (I am assuming out of sake of example) where your download of the project is located.

So, `cd Downloads` or if you placed the project on your `Desktop` or anywhere else, `cd [PROJECT LOCATION]`

NOTE: "cd" stands for "call directory". The terminal is case-sensitive, so mind you p and Q's. "Folder" same as "Directory".

C) Okay, are you in the correct directory per where your project was downloaded? My project folder is called `watson-beat-master`, yours should be the same. If not, see what the name of the folder you downloaded and decompressed is.

D) Now `cd [PROJECT DIRECTORY]`



# Linux
<hr>

Open your terminal per searching for it, opening your overview of applications on lefthand side, or if you have it pinned. 

`cd` to the root directory for this project.
