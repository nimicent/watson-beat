## Project Directory [Windows]: 

We are now going to "go into" (or call) the folder (the directory) we downloaded for Watson Beat.

Still have that terminal up and ready? If not, go to your Start Menu, and type "cmd". Right click to "Run as Administrator".

Command ```cd \```

Do you know which User you are? If not, press and hold on your keyboard `Ctr` `Alt` and `Del` to open your Task Manager. In the menu, select the User tab, that is your username. :)

Back to the terminal, ```Dir```. NOTE: Windows is not case-sensitive like other operating systems, so you could do ```dir``` too.

`dir` command lists all the directories. See the directory called "Users"? We are going to ```cd``` (cd = "call directory") which will place us in the "Users" directory.

```cd Users```

```dir```

See your username? 

```cd [YOUR_USERNAME]```

```dir```

Lets go to the project. I am assuming that this project is in the Downloads folder right now. If you placed it somewhere else, like ```Desktop```, then ```cd Desktop```. But I will assume that it is still within the Downloads folder for now.

```cd Downloads```
